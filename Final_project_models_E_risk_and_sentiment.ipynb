to or implied in any forward-looking statement.', 'These are in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report of Form 10-K and in the Company\\u2019sother filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.', 'The current volatility in global economic conditions and the financial markets may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.', 'The volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets since mid-2008 has rapidly impacted global economic conditions, resulting in significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth.', 'These conditions have led to economic contractions in the developed economies and reduced growth rates in the emerging markets.', 'Despite fiscal and monetary intervention, it is possible that further declines in consumer spending and global growth rates may occur in the foreseeable future.', 'Reduced consumer spending may cause changes in customer order patterns including order cancellations, and changes in the level of inventory at our customers, which may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.', 'The impact of the credit crisis and economic slowdown will vary by region and country.', 'The diversity of our geographic customer and operating footprint limits our reliance and exposure to any single economy.', 'These conditions have also resulted in asubstantial tightening of the credit markets, including lending by financial institutions and in the commercial paper market, both of which are sources of credit for our borrowing and liquidity.', 'This tightening of the credit markets has increased the cost of capital and reduced the availability of credit.', 'Based on our latest discussions, we believe that the financial institutions syndicated under our revolving credit facility are able to fulfill their commitments as of our filing date.', 'It is difficult to predict how long the current economic and capital and credit market conditions will continue, whether they will continue to deteriorate and which aspects of our products or business could be adversely affected.', 'However, if current levels of economic and capital and credit market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse impact, which may be material, on our business, the cost of and access to capital and credit markets, and our results of operations.', 'In addition, we monitor the financial condition of our customers on aregular basis based on public information or data provided directly to us.', 'If the financial condition of one of our major customers was negatively impacted by market conditions or liquidity, we could be adversely impacted in terms of accounts receivable and/or inventory specifically attributable to them.', 'Failure to maintain the integrity of our raw materials, supply chain and finished goods may adversely impact sales and our results of operations.', 'The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are manufactured and sold.', 'In addition, we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies.', 'We use avariety of strategies, methodologies and tools to identify current products standards, assess relative risks in our supply chain that can impact product integrity, monitor internal and external performance, test raw materials and finished goods to minimize the likelihood of product non-compliance.', 'If anon-compliance event went undetected, we could be subject to customer claims, penalties, litigation costs and/or settlements, remediation costs or loss of sales.', 'Competitive factors may negatively impact our sales and marketability.', 'The market for flavors and fragrances is fragmented and highly competitive.', 'IFF competes with many companies and some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product segments while others participate in many of the same segments.', 'In addition, some of our competitors may have greater financial and technical resources.', 'Increased competition by existing or future competitors, including aggressive price competition, could result in the need for us to reduce prices or increase spending and this could have an impact on sales and profitability.', 'We are subject to economic and social changes which may impact sales.', 'Demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances has been stimulated and broadened by changing social habits resulting from factors such as increases in personal income, dual-earner households, teenage population, leisure time, health concerns and urbanization and by the continued growth in world population.', 'Changes in any number of external economic factors, or changes in social or consumer preferences, could adversely impact our results of operations.', 'Approximately 60% of our sales occur in the developed markets of North America, Western Europe and Australasia with the remainder in emerging markets.', 'Accordingly, the impact on our operations will depend upon consumer spending on products for which we supply the flavor or fragrance in these global markets.', 'Results may be negatively impacted by the price, quality and availability of raw materials.', 'Raw materials are purchased from many sources from all over the world, including essential oils, extracts and concentrates derived from fruits, vegetables, flowers, woods and other botanicals, animal products, raw fruits and organic chemicals.', 'Disruptions in the supply or quality of ingredients or rising prices for ingredients purchased could adversely impact our results of operations and profitability.', 'Historically, we have experienced the greatest amount of volatility in natural products that represent approximately 50% of raw material purchases.', 'Availability and pricing of these products can be impacted by crop size and quality, demand balance or alternative land use.', 'To mitigate our sourcing risk, we maintain strategic stock levels covering multiple periods for critical items and/or time purchases to capitalize on favorable market conditions.', 'Results may be negatively impacted by the inability to implement our business strategy, including the achievement of anticipated cost savings, profitability or growth targets.', 'We are committed to those particular business strategies and market segments that have been identified as likely to drive profitable future growth and improve operations and customer service.', 'If we are unable to successfully and timely implement these strategies, it would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.', 'Results may be negatively affected by the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in principal foreign markets and the effectiveness of hedging and risk management strategies.', 'Our operations are conducted in many countries, the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates.', 'The exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated and may continue to do so in the future.', 'We employ avariety of techniques to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, including sourcing strategies and alimited number of foreign currency hedging activities.', 'However, volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our reported results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.', 'Results may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation.', 'We are involved in anumber of legal claims.', 'While we believe that related insurance coverage is adequate with respect to such claims, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation.', 'In addition, we cannot provide assurance that future events will not require an increase in the amount accrued for any such claims, or require accrual for one or more claims that has not been previously accrued.', 'Results and cash flows may be negatively impacted by future pension funding and other postretirement obligations.', 'We establish assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions regarding pension funding and other postretirement benefit obligations based on current market conditions, plan participants, asset returns, interest rates and other factors.', 'Changes in pension and other postretirement benefits, plan assets, and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in capital markets, employee demographics and actuarial assumptions.', 'These changes may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.', 'Results may be negatively impacted by the effect of legal and regulatory requirements, as well as restrictions imposed on operations by foreign and domestic governmental entities.', 'The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration, the Agriculture Department, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration and state authorities.', 'In addition, we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies.', 'Our foreign operations are subject to similar substantial governmental regulation and oversight standards in anumber of countries, including extensive requirements within the European Union.', 'Costs or investments necessary to maintain compliance with existing or future governmental regulations may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.', 'We may face risks associated with events which may affect the world economy.', 'World events such as terrorist attacks, or regional conflicts have and may in the future weaken world economies.', 'Any resulting weaknesses in these economies may

applicable provisions of Delaware law, or our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock and the terms of our outstanding debt.', '16 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION We are dependent on fee-based business for amajority of our revenues, which may be affected adversely by market volatility, adownturn in economic conditions, underperformance and/or negative trends in investment preferences.', 'Our principal operational focus is on fee-based business, which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interest-generating products and services.', 'Fees for many of our products and services are based on the market value of assets under management, custody or administration; the volume of transactions processed; securities lending volume and spreads; fees for other services rendered; and in certain businesses, fees calculated as apercentage of our clients\\u2019 earnings, all of which may be impacted negatively by market volatility, adownturn in economic conditions, underperformance and/or negative trends in investment preferences.', 'For example, downturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debt-related investments resulting from market disruption, illiquidity or other factors historically have reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others, which generally impacted our earnings negatively.', 'Further, although we do not hold, invest in, or custody cryptocurrency assets, the markets in which they trade are highly volatile and volatility in these markets may impact the markets for other assets that we hold, invest in, or custody, which could also impact our fees or financial condition.', 'Market volatility and/or weak economic conditions also may affect wealth creation, investment preferences, trading activities, and savings patterns, which impact demand for certain products and services that we provide.', 'Our earnings also may be affected by poor investment returns or changes in investment preferences driven by factors beyond market volatility or weak economic conditions.', 'Poor absolute or relative investment performance in funds or client accounts that we manage or in investment products that we design or provide may result in declines in the market values of portfolios that we manage and/or administer and may affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients.', 'For example, from time to time in the past, outflows from certain of our products driven by relative investment performance or other factors adversely impacted our overall fees derived from assets that we manage.', 'Broader changes in investment preferences that lead to less investment in mutual funds or other collective funds, such as the shift in investor preference to lower fee products, could also impact our earnings negatively.', 'Changes in interest rates can affect our earnings negatively.', 'The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings.', 'Interest rate changes could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities.', 'In response to rising inflation, the Federal Reserve Board increased interest rates from historically low levels during 2022 and 2023.', 'While arising interest rate environment generally has apositive effect on our net interest margin, in some circumstances, arise in interest rates also may affect us negatively.', 'For example, the rapid increases in interest rates during 2022 and 2023 adversely impacted the value of certain of our investment securities, with resultant impacts on our capital, liquidity, and earnings.', 'Additionally, higher interest rates historically have caused, and may in the future cause: market volatility and downturns in equity markets, resulting in adecrease in the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others, which generally impact our earnings negatively; our clients to transfer funds into investments with higher rates of return, resulting in decreased deposit levels and higher fund or account redemptions; our borrowers to experience difficulties in making higher interest payments, resulting in increased credit costs, provisions for loan and lease losses and charge-offs; reduced bond and fixed income fund liquidity, resulting in lower performance, yields and fees; or higher funding costs.', 'Conversely, low-interest-rate environments generally result in acompressed net interest margin and also have anegative impact on our fees earned on certain of our products.', 'For example, in the past we waived certain fees associated with money market funds due to the low level of short-term interest rates.', 'Low net interest margins and fee waivers each negatively impact our earnings.', 'Although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of interest rate risks, if our assumptions about any number of variables are incorrect, these policies and procedures to mitigate risk may be ineffective, which could impact earnings negatively.', 'Please see \\u201cMarket Risk\\u201d in the \\u201cRisk Management\\u201d section included in Item 7, \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\\u201d for amore detailed discussion of interest rate and market risks we face.', 'Changes in the monetary, trade and other policies of various regulatory authorities, central banks, governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negatively.', 'The monetary, trade and other policies of U.S. and international governments, agencies and regulatory bodies have asignificant impact on economic conditions and overall financial market performance.', 'For example, the Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. through quantitative tightening and/or easing, and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing, and play arole in contributing to or moderating levels of inflation, all of which meaningfully impact our earnings.', 'Further, their policies can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available, which may increase the risk that borrowers fail to repay their loans from us.', 'Changes in monetary, trade and other governmental policies are beyond our ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 17 control and can be difficult to predict, and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.', 'Macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty in the global economy, including the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe, including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets, could have asignificant adverse effect on our earnings.', 'Risks and concerns about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe could have adetrimental impact on economic and market conditions in these or other markets across the world.', 'Foreign market and economic disruptions have affected, and may in the future affect, consumer confidence levels and spending, international trade policy, personal bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence of and default on consumer debt, and home prices.', 'Additionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by the liquidity or capital deficiencies (actual or perceived) of financial institutions and related industry and government actions, current or anticipated impact of military conflict (including the continuing military conflicts involving Ukraine and the Russian Federation and Israel and Hamas and other evolving events in the Middle East), terrorism, political or civil unrest, public health epidemics or pandemics, the exit or potential exit of one or more countries from the EU, sovereign debt downgrades or debt crises, or other geopolitical events.', 'For example, developments related to the U.S. federal debt ceiling, including the possibility of agovernment shutdown, default by the U.S. government on its debt obligations, or related credit-rating downgrades, could have adverse effects on the broader economy, disrupt access to capital markets, and contribute to, or worsen, an economic recession.', 'The cumulative effect of uncertain business conditions or economic challenges faced in various foreign markets, including fiscal or monetary concerns, economic downturns and the possibility of arecession in some jurisdictions, other economic factors (including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and changes to tax laws or the application or enforcement practices of such laws), or volatility or lack of confidence in the financial markets may adversely affect certain portions of our business, financial condition, and results of operations.', 'Declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively.', 'Our investment securities portfolio represents agreater proportion, and our loan portfolio represents asmaller proportion, of our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions.', 'The value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio, which is generally determined based upon market values available from third-party sources, have fluctuated, and may continue in the future to fluctuate, as aresult of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions.', 'For example, in 2023, and again in early 2024, we realized notable losses on the sale of available for sale securities and we may realize additional losses in the future.', 'Declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital, liquidity, and, to the extent we realize losses, earnings.', 'Although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of market risks, including hedging-related strategies, those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks.', 'Accordingly, market risks have, from time to time, negatively affected the value of securities held in our investment portfolio and in the future we could suffer additional adverse effects as aresult of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly.', 'Volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings.', 'We provide foreign exchange services to our clients, primarily in connection with our global custody business.', 'Foreign currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity.', 'Foreign currency volatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income.', 'Fluctuations in exchange rates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell acurrency other than the U.S. dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods.', 'We also are exposed to non-trading foreign currency risk as aresult of our holdings of non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities, investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, and future non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue and expense.', 'We have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks, including hedging-related strategies.', 'Any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may impact earnings negatively.', 'Please see

for amore detailed discussion of market risks we face.', 'Changes in anumber of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negatively.', 'In past periods, reductions in the volatility of currency-trading markets, the level of cross-border investing activity, and the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending negatively.', 'If these conditions occur in the future, our earnings from these activities may be affected negatively.', 'In certain of our businesses, such as securities lending, our fee is calculated as apercentage of our clients\\u2019 earnings, such that market and other factors that reduce our clients\\u2019 earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues.', '18 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION Many types of operational risks can affect our earnings negatively.', 'We regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses.', 'Despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational risk, our risk management program may not be effective in all cases.', 'Factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in size, scale and scope, some or all of which may be exacerbated by the trend toward hybrid and remote working arrangements in recent years, include: - failures of technological systems or networks or breaches of security measures, including, but not limited to, those resulting from computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other information security incidents; - human errors or omissions, including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures; - theft, fraud or misappropriation of assets, whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties; - defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems; - breakdowns in processes and internal controls; over-reliance on manual processes and controls, which are less scalable than automated processes and controls; - failures of the systems and facilities that support our operations; - failure of any third-party vendor to properly execute the processes on which Northern Trust relies; - unsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer systems upgrades; - defects in product design or delivery; - difficulty in accurately pricing assets, which can be aggravated by market volatility and illiquidity and lack of reliable pricing from third-party vendors; - negative developments in relationships with key counterparties, third-party vendors, employees or associates in our day-to-day operations; and - external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as pandemics, geopolitical events, political or social unrest, natural disasters or acts of terrorism.', 'While we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors, these plans may not operate

businesses\\u2014particularly as our geographic footprint, product pipeline and client needs and expectations evolve\\u2014and consequently fail to enhance our controls and business continuity plans to address those changes in an adequate or timely fashion.', 'If our controls and business continuity plans do not address the factors noted above and operate to mitigate the associated risks successfully, such factors may have anegative impact on our business (including operational resilience), financial condition or results of operations.', 'In addition, an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating arisk culture in which all employees fully understand the inherent risk in our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions.', 'We continue to enhance our risk management program to support our risk culture, ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate for our role as amajor financial institution.', 'Nonetheless, if we fail to

systems, including those that we outsource to providers, may fail to operate properly or become disabled, overloaded or damaged as aresult of anumber of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could have anegative effect on our ability to conduct our business activities.', 'The third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks (including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely), and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be affected adversely, perhaps materially, by failures, terminations, errors or malfeasance by, or attacks or constraints on, one or more financial, technology, infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business.', 'ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION Our business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as aresult of any system, network or operational failure or disruption.', 'Breaches of our security measures, including, but not limited to, those resulting from cyber-attacks or other information security incidents, may result in losses.', 'Our systems involve the storage, transmission and other processing of clients\\u2019 and our personal, proprietary, confidential and sensitive information, and security breaches, including cyber-attacks or other information security incidents, could expose us to arisk of theft, loss, destruction, gathering, monitoring, dissemination, misappropriation, misuse, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to this information.', 'Despite our implementation of avariety of security measures, our computer systems, networks, and data, including clients\\u2019 or our personal, proprietary, confidential and sensitive information, could be subject to cyber-attacks or other information security incidents, such as, among other things, from physical and electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering, malware and computer virus attacks, ransomware attacks, social engineering attacks (including phishing attacks) or denial-of-service attacks.', 'Our security measures also may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, failure of our controls with respect to access to our systems, malfeasance or otherwise.', 'Any failure, interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations and could subject us to liability claims, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.', 'Data privacy and security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the evolving proliferation of new technologies, the use of internet-based solutions, mobile devices, and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and rapidly evolving techniques of hackers, terrorists, organized crime and other external parties, including foreign state actors and state-sponsored actors, any of which may see their effectiveness enhanced by the use of artificial intelligence.', 'Data privacy and security risks also may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties, or may result from human error, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failure or other technological failure.', 'If we fail to continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure to ensure effective data privacy and security relative to the type, size and complexity of our operations, we could become more vulnerable to cyber-attacks and other information security incidents and, consequently, subject to significant regulatory penalties and reputational damage.', 'Also, like many large enterprises, the trend in the past several years toward ahybrid work environment that includes acombination of in-office and remote work creates abroader attack surface for, and potential vulnerabilities from, cyber threats.', 'While we generally conduct security assessments on third-party vendors, we cannot be certain that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand acyber-attack or other information security incident.', 'Some of our vendors may store or have access to our data and may not have effective controls, processes, or practices to protect our information from loss, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized use or misappropriation, cyber-attacks or other information security incidents.', 'In addition, our clients often use personal devices, such as computers, smart phones and tablets, which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft, as well as third parties with whom they share information used for authentication, to access our systems and networks and manage their accounts, which may heighten the risk of system failures, interruptions or security breaches.', 'Moreover, the increased use of mobile and cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks.', 'Reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and networks and prevent cyber-attacks or other information security incidents could disrupt our operations or the operations of our or their service providers and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal, confidential, proprietary, or other sensitive information or the inability to conduct ordinary business operations.', 'In addition, there is arisk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that

policies or procedures, or acyber-attack or other information security incident affecting any of these third parties could harm our business.', 'In recent years, several financial services firms suffered successful cyber-attacks launched both domestically and from abroad, resulting in the disruption of services to clients, loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private information, and reputational harm.', 'We and our clients have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to awide variety of cyber-attacks and other similar threats, including computer viruses, ransomware and other malicious code, distributed denial-of-service attacks, and phishing and vishing attacks, and it is possible that we could suffer material losses resulting from abreach.', 'Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems and networks change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against atarget, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, to implement adequate preventative measures, or to address them until they are discovered.', 'In addition, successful cyber-attacks may persist for an extended period of time before being detected.', 'Because any investigation of an information security incident would be inherently unpredictable, the extent of aparticular information security incident and the path of investigating the incident may not be immediately clear.', 'It may take asignificant amount of time before such an 20 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known.', 'While such an investigation is ongoing, we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, and communication to the public, regulators, clients and other stakeholders may be inaccurate, any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of an information security incident.', 'We could be the subject of legal claims or proceedings related to information security incidents, including regulatory investigations and other legal actions, carrying the potential for damages, fines, sanctions or other penalties, injunctive relief requiring costly compliance measures and reputational damage.', 'Further, the market perception of the effectiveness of our information security measures could be harmed, our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients in conjunction with security incidents, each of which could have anegative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.', 'Abreach of our security also may affect adversely our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our business.', 'An event that results in the loss of information also may require us to reconstruct lost data or reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring services, which could be costly and have anegative impact on our business and reputation.', 'Although we maintain insurance coverage in the event of information theft, damage, or destruction from cyber-attacks or other information security incidents, there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies, that the amount of insurance will be adequate to cover such losses, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that our insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.', 'Further, even if not directed at us, attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system or on our counterparties could affect, directly or indirectly, aspects of our business.', 'Errors, breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability, result in losses or have anegative effect on our earnings in other ways.', 'In our asset servicing, investment management, fiduciary administration and other business activities, we effect or process transactions for clients and for ourselves that involve very large amounts of money.', 'Failure to manage or mitigate operational risks properly can have adverse consequences, and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses.', 'Further, remote working and other modified business practices initiated in recent years, combined with the increasing sophistication and frequency of potential cyber-attacks and other information security incidents, have heightened our operational and execution risk.', 'Given the high volume of transactions we process, errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected.', 'Our dependence on technology, and the need to update frequently our technology infrastructure, exposes us to risks that also can result in losses.', 'Our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure, both internal and external, to record and process, among other things, alarge volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data, in many currencies, on adaily basis, across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions.', 'Due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations, combined with the increasing sophistication and frequency of potential cyber-attacks and other information security incidents, we must constantly improve and update our information technology infrastructure.', 'Upgrading, replacing, and modernizing these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation, integration and security risks that could cause financial, reputational, and operational harm.', 'In recent years, there has been an acceleration in the transition from traditional to digital financial services and heightened customer expectations in this area, and this transition may require us to invest greater resources in technological advancements.', 'Failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business and regulatory issues prior to and during the introduction and deployment of key technological systems or networks or failure to align operational capabilities adequately with evolving client commitments and expectations may have anegative impact on our results of operations.', 'The failure to respond properly to, and invest in, changes and advancements in technology and/or to compete for and retain employees with the necessary technical skills and expertise could limit our ability to attract and retain clients, prevent us from offering products and services comparable to those offered by our competitors, inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements or otherwise have amaterial adverse effect on our operations.', 'ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION Afailure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.', 'We regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures.', 'Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system will be met.', 'Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.', 'If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports.', 'In addition, there are risks that individuals, either employees or contractors, consciously circumvent established control mechanisms by, for example, exceeding trading or investment management limitations, or committing fraud.', 'Failure of any of our third-party vendors (or their vendors) to perform can result in losses.', 'Third-party vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, and network access.', 'Our use of third-party vendors exposes us to the risk that such vendors (or their vendors) may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations, including with respect to indemnification and information security, and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers.', 'While we have established risk management processes and continuity plans, any disruptions in service from akey vendor for any reason or poor performance of services have in the past and could in the future have anegative effect on our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business.', 'Replacing these third-party vendors or performing the tasks they perform for ourselves has in the past and could in the future create significant delay and expense.', 'We are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may affect our business adversely.', 'In conducting our U.S. and non-U.S. business, we are subject to risks of loss and adverse economic impacts from various unfavorable political, economic, legal, public health, or other developments, including social or political instability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, unfavorable tax rate changes, tax court rulings and changes in laws and regulations.', 'Less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments heighten these risks in various emerging markets.', 'Our non-U.S. operations accounted for 32% of our revenue in 2023.', 'Our non-U.S. businesses are subject to extensive regulation by various non-U.S. regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, central banks and other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate.', 'In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving and may be applied with extra scrutiny to foreign companies.', 'Moreover, the regulatory and supervisory standards and expectations in one jurisdiction may not conform with standards or expectations in other jurisdictions.', 'Even within aparticular jurisdiction, the standards and expectations of multiple supervisory agencies exercising authority over our affairs may not be harmonized fully.', 'Accordingly, it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions.', 'Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in aparticular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally.', 'The failure to mitigate properly such risks or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions, which could affect our business and results of operations adversely.', 'We actively strive to optimize our geographic footprint.', 'This optimization may occur by establishing operations in lower-cost locations or by outsourcing to third-party vendors in various jurisdictions.', 'These efforts expose us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality, control or effective management within these operations.', 'In addition, we are exposed to the relevant macroeconomic, political, public health, and similar risks generally involved in doing business in those jurisdictions.', 'The increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk.', 'During periods of transition, greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining ahigh level of service delivery.', 'In addition, we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments, money laundering, and laws that prohibit us from doing business with certain individuals, groups and countries, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the UK Bribery Act, and economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar agencies worldwide.', 'While we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring, the geographic diversity of our operations, employees, clients and customers, as well as the vendors and other third parties with whom we deal, presents the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules, regulations, laws or programs and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or affect our reputation adversely.', '22 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION Failure to control our costs and expenses adequately could affect our earnings negatively.', 'Our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results.', 'Through various parts of our business strategy, we aim to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses, including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets.', 'In recent years, increased expenses have affected\\u2014and afailure to control our costs and expenses in the future, whether as aresult of inflation or otherwise, could affect\\u2014our earnings negatively.', 'Pandemics, natural disasters, global climate change, acts of terrorism, geopolitical tensions, and global conflicts may have anegative impact on our business and operations.', 'Pandemics, natural disasters, global climate change, acts of terrorism, geopolitical tensions, global conflicts (including the continuing military conflicts involving Ukraine and the Russian Federation and Israel and Hamas) or other similar events, as well as government actions or other restrictions in connection with such events, have had in the past, or may in the future have, anegative impact on our business and operations.', 'While we have in place business continuity plans, such events may still damage our facilities, disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business (including communications and technology), result in harm to or cause travel limitations on our employees, impose significant compliance costs with new financial and economic sanctions regimes, and have asimilar impact on our clients, suppliers, third-party vendors and counterparties.', 'For example, in some jurisdictions such as the Russian Federation, local market restrictions, laws, sanctions programs or government intervention inhibit our clients\\u2019 and our ability to access or transfer cash or securities held for clients through subcustodians and clearing agencies.', 'When such client deposit liabilities are on our consolidated balance sheet, we maintain acorresponding amount of cash on deposit with the subcustodian or clearing agency, which increases our credit exposure to that entity and can accumulate over time based upon distributions on, or other activities related to, our clients\\u2019 assets.', 'If the subcustodian or clearing agency were to become insolvent in circumstances not involving expropriation of assets or other sovereign risk events and/or factors or events beyond our reasonable control that excuse performance under force majeure or other contractual provisions, the risk of loss on such cash on deposit may potentially be incurred by us.', 'As of December 31, 2023, we held cash that accumulates in relation to Russian securities with our subcustodian and/or clearing agencies for the benefit of certain clients in our Asset Servicing business which are subject to restrictions that inhibit our ability to access or transfer such deposits, and which amount is expected to increase significantly over time as long as the sanctions and other relevant restrictions remain in effect.', 'Our subcustodian is also asubsidiary of alarge, global financial institution with whom we have other credit exposures, which may limit the financial relationship we may have with this counterparty and has in the past made, and may in the future make, compliance with specific U.S. regulatory single counterparty credit limits more challenging.', 'The foregoing or similar events also could impact us negatively to the extent that they result in reduced capital markets activity, lower asset price levels, or disruptions in general economic activity in the U.S. or abroad, or in financial market settlement functions.', 'In addition, these or similar events may impact economic growth negatively, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations, and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict.', 'Please see \\u201cStrategic Risks\\u201d in this \\u201cRisk Factors\\u201d section for further description of risks associated with climate change.', 'Failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses, both of which reduce our earnings.', 'We evaluate extensions of credit before we make them and provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, including undrawn credit commitments.', 'This process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions through the life of these credit exposures.', 'Challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessments and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors.', 'Allowances that prove to be inadequate may require us to realize increased provisions for credit losses or write down the value of certain assets on our balance sheet, which result in losses and/or increased provisions for credit losses and in turn would affect earnings negatively.', 'Market volatility and/or weak economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses, both of which reduce our earnings.', 'Credit risk levels and our earnings can be affected by market volatility and/or weakness in the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit, adeterioration in credit quality, or areduced demand for credit.', 'Adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers resulting from market volatility, elevated interest rates, and/or weakened economic conditions could impact the borrowers\\u2019 abilities to repay outstanding loans, which could in turn impact our financial condition and results of operations negatively.', 'ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION The failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss.', 'The financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions, including banks, broker-dealers, collective investment funds and insurance companies.', 'As aresult of these interconnections, we and many of our clients have counterparty exposure to other financial institutions.', 'This counterparty exposure presents risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss.', 'Instability in the financial markets, or in certain countries where these counterparties are domiciled, has resulted historically in some financial institutions becoming less creditworthy.', 'During such periods of instability, we are exposed to increased counterparty risks, both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients.', 'Changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly, are often based upon avariety of factors and can be difficult to predict.', 'In addition, the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain.', 'Further, the consolidation of financial services firms and the failures of other financial institutions has in the past increased, and may in the future increase, the concentration of our counterparty risk.', 'These risks are heightened by the fact that our operating model relies on the use of unaffiliated sub-custodians to agreater degree than certain of our competitors that have banking operations in more jurisdictions than we do.', 'We are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients\\u2019 counterparty credit risk.', 'If asignificant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us, we could incur financial losses that have amaterial and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.', 'If we do not manage our liquidity effectively, our business could suffer.', 'Liquidity is essential for the operation of our business.', 'Market conditions, unforeseen outflows of funds or other events could have anegative effect on our level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund new business transactions at areasonable cost and in atimely manner.', 'If our access to stable and low-cost sources of funding, such as customer deposits, is reduced, we may need to use alternative funding, which could be more expensive or of limited availability.', 'Further evolution in the regulatory requirements relating to liquidity and risk management also may impact us negatively.', 'Additional regulations may impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions, including the Corporation and the Bank.', 'Given the overlap and complex interactions of these regulations with other regulatory changes, the full impact of the adopted and proposed regulations remains uncertain until their full implementation.', 'In addition, asignificant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large, complex clients, which, by their nature, require substantial liquidity.', 'Our failure to manage successfully the liquidity and balance sheet issues attendant to this portion of our business may have anegative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow.', 'We also manage investment products that, while not obligations of ours, may be exposed to liquidity risks.', 'These products, such as money market and other short-term investments provide clients aright to the return of cash or assets on limited notice.', 'If clients demand areturn of their cash or assets, particularly on limited notice, and these investment products do not have the liquidity to support those demands, we could be forced to sell investment securities held by these investment products at unfavorable prices potentially damaging our reputation with the investment

cash management needs of our clients, to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes, including capital rules, or for other purposes.', 'However, our ability to access the capital markets, if needed, will depend on anumber of factors, including the state of the financial markets.', 'Rising interest rates, disruptions in financial markets, negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength, or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us.', 'For example, in the event of future turmoil in the banking 24 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION industry or other idiosyncratic events, there is no guarantee that the U.S. government will invoke the systemic risk exception, create additional liquidity programs, or take any other action to stabilize the banking industry or provide liquidity.', 'Any diminished ability to access short-term funding or capital markets to raise additional capital, if needed, could subject us to liability, restrict our ability to grow, require us to take actions that would affect our earnings negatively or otherwise affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan, capital plan and strategic goals adversely.', 'Any downgrades in our credit ratings, or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength, could affect our borrowing costs, capital costs and liquidity adversely.', 'Rating agencies publish credit ratings and outlooks on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities.', 'Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and thus may change from time to time based on the agencies\\u2019

frameworks for our industry or certain security types, which are subject to revision from time to time, and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally.', 'Downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our borrowing costs, our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity adversely.', 'Afailure to maintain an acceptable credit rating also may preclude us from being competitive in certain products.', 'Additionally, our counterparties, as well as our clients, rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us.', 'If we experience diminished financial strength or stability, actual or perceived, adecline in our stock price or areduced credit rating, our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions, secured or unsecured, with us, our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers, or our prospective clients may select other service providers, all of which may have other adverse effects on our business.', 'The risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in amarket environment in which the consolidation, and in some instances failure, of financial institutions, including major global financial institutions, could result in asmaller number of larger counterparties and competitors.', 'If our counterparties perceive us to be aless viable counterparty, our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients, on our or our clients\\u2019 behalf, will be compromised materially.', 'If our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or aportion of the services we provide to them, our revenues will decrease accordingly.', 'Failure to comply with regulations and/or supervisory expectations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business, or that reduce earnings.', 'Virtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated, generally by domestic and foreign governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions.', 'These regulations cover avariety of matters, including prohibited activities, required capital levels, resolution planning, human trafficking and modern slavery, and data privacy and security.', 'Some of these requirements are directed specifically at protecting depositors of the Bank, the U.S. DIF and the banking system as awhole, not our stockholders or other security holders.', 'Regulatory violations or the failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties, require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business, result in limitations on our ability to conduct business, restrict our ability to expand or impact our reputation adversely.', 'Failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies, whether formal or based upon supervisory expectations, on atimely basis could affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations adversely.', 'Similarly, changes in laws or failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws or regulations may impact our results of operations and financial condition negatively.', 'We are subject to extensive and evolving government regulation and supervision that impacts our operations.', 'Changes by the U.S. and other governments to laws, regulations and policies applicable to the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make regulatory compliance more difficult and costly.', 'We operate in ahighly regulated environment, and are subject to acomprehensive statutory and regulatory regime affecting all aspects of our business and operations, including oversight by governmental agencies both inside and outside the U.S.', 'Various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened scrutiny of financial institutions through many regulatory initiatives.', 'These initiatives have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of acompliance violation, even if the failure to comply was inadvertent or reflects adifference in interpretation.', 'We have programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements.', 'We cannot provide assurance that these programs and policies are or will be adequate to identify and manage internal and external compliance risks.', 'For example, our business may be adversely impacted by actual or alleged misconduct by an employee or other negative outcomes caused by human error.', 'Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory and supervisory policies or their interpretation or implementation and the continued heightening of regulatory and supervisory requirements could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways.', 'ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION Additionally, governments and regulators may take actions that increase intervention in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry, and these likely would involve additional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies.', 'Any such actions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks, lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of aviolation, affect our ability to compete successfully, and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways.', 'The full scope and impact of possible legislative or regulatory changes and the extent of regulatory activity is uncertain and difficult to predict.', 'For example, we are unable to predict what, if any, changes to financial services laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry may be enacted by the U.S. Congress and what the impact of any such changes will be upon our business, financial condition, and results of operations.', 'The evolving regulatory and supervisory environment and uncertainty about the timing and scope of future laws, regulations and policies may contribute to decisions we may make to suspend, reduce or withdraw from existing businesses, activities or initiatives, which may result in potential lost revenue or significant restructuring or related costs or exposures.', 'We also face the risk of becoming subject to new or more stringent requirements in connection with the introduction of new regulations or modification of existing regulations, which could require us to hold more capital or liquidity or have other adverse effects on our businesses or profitability.', 'For example, proposed changes to applicable capital and liquidity requirements, such as the Basel III Endgame Proposal and the long-term debt proposal, could result in increased expenses or cost of funding, which could negatively affect our financial results or our ability to pay dividends and engage in share repurchases.', 'For more information concerning our legal and regulatory obligations with respect to Basel III and long-term debt requirements, see \\u201cSupervision and Regulation\\u201d in Item 1, \\u201cBusiness.\\u201d In addition, regulatory responses in connection with severe market downturns or unforeseen stress events may alter or disrupt our planned future strategies and actions.', 'Adverse developments affecting the overall strength and soundness of other financial institutions, the financial services industry as awhole and the general economic climate

heightened during periods when credit, equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile, or when clients or investors are experiencing losses.', 'In addition, regulators, tax authorities and courts have increasingly sought to hold financial institutions liable for the misconduct of their clients where such regulators and courts have determined that the

by multiple regulators and other governmental entities or tax authorities in different jurisdictions.', 'Responding to inquiries, investigations, and proceedings, regardless of the outcome of the matter, is time consuming and expensive and can divert the attention of our senior management from our business.', 'The outcome of such proceedings may be difficult to predict or estimate until late

overall results.', 'Due to these and other factors we may need to liquidate investments prior to maturity at aloss in order to satisfy liabilities or be forced to reinvest funds in alower rate environment.', 'Although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in achanging interest rate environment, we may not be able to effectively mitigate, and we may sometimes choose based on economic considerations and other factors not to fully mitigate, the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities.', 'In addition to compressing spreads and reducing net investment income, such an environment may cause policies to remain in force for longer periods than we anticipated in our pricing, potentially resulting in greater claims costs than we expected and resulting in lower overall returns on business in force.', 'In addition to the potential effect of natural or man-made disasters, significant changes in mortality or morbidity could emerge gradually over time, due to changes in the natural environment, the health habits of the insured population, treatment patterns and technologies for disease or disability, the economic environment, or other factors.', 'For certain of our products, market performance and interest rates (as well as the regulatory environment, as discussed further below) impact the level of statutory reserves and statutory capital we are required to hold, and may have an adverse effect on profitability and returns on capital associated with these products.', 'There may be cases where certain assets in normally active markets with significant observable data become inactive with insufficient observable data due to the current financial environment or market conditions.', 'The occurrence of natural disasters, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, fires, explosions, pandemic disease and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism and military actions, could adversely affect our operations, results of operations or financial condition, including in the following respects: Catastrophic loss of life due to natural or man-made disasters could cause us to pay benefits at higher levels and/or materially earlier than anticipated and could lead to unexpected changes in persistency rates.', 'Aman-made or natural disaster, such as an earthquake in Japan, could result in disruptions in our operations, losses in our investment portfolio or the failure of our counterparties to perform, or cause significant volatility in global financial markets.']\",\n          \"['We are also subject to potential changes in the political environment that can affect public policy and can adversely affect the markets for our products.', 'Historically, rating agencies take action to lower ratings due to, among other things, perceived concerns about liquidity or solvency, the competitive environment in the insurance industry, the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims, the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations, and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies.', 'While there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we have no reason to believe the lenders participating in our credit agreement will not be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement.', 'Company-specific issues and market developments generally in the insurance industry and in the regulatory environment may have caused this volatility.']\",\n          \"['These factors include, among others: Worldwide and domestic supplies of, and demand for, oil, natural gas, NGL and refined products; The cost of exploring for, developing, producing, refining and marketing oil, natural gas, NGL and refined products; Operational impacts such as production disruptions, technological advances and regional market conditions, including available transportation capacity and infrastructure constraints in producing areas; Changes in weather patterns and climate; The impacts of the members of OPEC and other non-OPEC member-producing nations that may agree to and maintain production levels; The worldwide military and political environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or outbreak of armed hostilities or acts of terrorism in the United States, or elsewhere; The price and availability of alternative and competing fuels; Technological advances affecting energy consumption and supply; Domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; Shareholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGL; Additional or increased nationalization and expropriation activities by foreign governments; The impact and uncertainty of world health events; Volatility in commodity futures markets; The effect of energy conservation efforts; and Global inventory levels and general economic conditions.', 'Climate change and further regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may adversely affect Occidental\\u2019soperations or results.', 'Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional and local legislation and regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.', 'In December 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth\\u2019satmosphere and other climatic changes.', 'Based on these findings, the EPA began adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA).', 'For example, the EPA issued rules restricting methane emissions from hydraulically fractured and refractured gas wells, compressors, pneumatic controls, storage vessels, and natural gas processing plants.', 'In addition, in August 2019, the EPA issued the Affordable Clean Energy rule that designates heat rate improvement, or efficiency improvement, as the best system of emissions reduction for carbon dioxide from existing coal-fired electric utility generating units.', 'In the absence of federal legislation to significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to date, many state governments have established rules aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including greenhouse gas cap and trade programs.', 'Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, including refineries and natural gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances.', 'These and other government actions relating to greenhouse gas emissions could require Occidental to incur increased operating and maintenance costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances, pay carbon taxes, or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements, or they could promote the use of alternative sources of energy and thereby decrease demand for oil, natural gas, NGL and other products that Occidental\\u2019sbusinesses produce.', 'Consequently, government actions designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on Occidental\\u2019sbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reserves.', 'It is difficult to predict the timing and certainty of such government actions and their ultimate effect on Occidental, which could depend on, among other things, the type and extent of greenhouse gas reductions required, the availability and price of emissions allowances or credits, the availability and price of alternative fuel sources, the energy sectors covered, and Occidental\\u2019sability to recover the costs incurred through its operating agreements or the pricing of its oil, natural gas, NGL and other products.', 'The occurrence of events such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, earthquakes or other acts of nature, well blowouts, pandemics, fires, explosions, pipeline ruptures, chemical releases, oil releases, including maritime releases, releases into navigable waters, and groundwater contamination, material or mechanical failure, industrial accidents, physical attacks, abnormally pressured or structured formations and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect Occidental\\u2019sbusinesses and the communities in which it operates.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"climate_words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

Exelon is subject to extensive environmental regulation and associated compliance costs. Regulations under section 316(b) of the Federal Clean Water Act require actions to address the entrainment and impingement of aquatic organisms in the cooling water intakes of electric generation facilities. These new generating facilities may be more efficient than Generation\\u2019sfacilities. Lower capacity factors increase Generation\\u2019soperating costs by requiring Generation to generate additional energy from its fossil or hydroelectric facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy Generation\\u2019sobligations to Com Ed and PECO and other committed third-party sales. Remediation actions, including those required to address performance issues, could result in increased costs due to accelerated fuel amortization and/or increased outage costs. Also, any regulatory action relating to the availability of arepository for spent nuclear fuel may adversely affect Generation\\u2019sability to fully decommission the nuclear units. In addition, through the NRC\\u2019s \\u201cwaste confidence\\u201d rule, the NRC has determined that, if necessary, spent fuel generated in any reactor can be stored safely and without significant environmental impacts for at least 30 years beyond the licensed life for operation, which may include the term of arevised or renewed license of that reactor, at its spent fuel storage basin or at either onsite or offsite independent spent fuel storage installations. The North American transmission grid is highly interconnected and, in extraordinary circumstances, disruptions at apoint within the grid can cause asystemic response that results in an extensive power outage. Extreme weather conditions or storms may affect the availability of generation capacity and transmission, limiting Generation\\u2019sability to source or send power to where it is sold. Generation depends on coal, natural gas and nuclear fuel assemblies to operate its generating facilities. Mandatory RPS could negatively affect Com Ed\\u2019sand PECO\\u2019scosts. Federal or state legislation mandating the use of renewable and alternative fuel sources, such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal, could result in significant changes in Com Ed\\u2019sand PECO\\u2019sbusinesses, including renewable energy credit purchase costs, purchased power and potentially renewable energy credit costs and capital expenditures. However, extreme weather conditions or storms may stress Com Ed\\u2019sand PECO\\u2019stransmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs and limiting each company\\u2019sability to meet peak customer demand. Select northeast and mid-Atlantic states have developed amodel rule, via the RGGI, to regulate carbon emissions from fossil-fired generation in participating states starting in 2009. Federal and/or state legislation to regulate carbon emissions could occur in the future. If these plans become effective, Exelon and Generation may incur costs to either further limit the emissions from certain of their fossil-fuel fired facilities or in procuring emission allowance credits issued by various governing bodies. For additional information regarding environmental matters, including nuclear generating station groundwater, see \\u201cEnvironmental Regulation\\u201d in ITEM 1 of this Form 10-K. War, acts and threats of terrorism and natural disaster may adversely affect Exelon\\u2019sresults of operations, its ability to raise capital and its future growth.\",\n          \"Any prolonged disruption to the operations at any of these facilities, whether due to labor difficulties, destruction of or damage to any facility, power interruptions, cybersecurity incidents, failure of key technology systems, weather events or natural disasters (including the potential impacts of climate change) or other reasons, could harm our customer relationships, impede our ability to generate sales and have amaterial adverse effect on the Company\\u2019sresults of operations or financial condition. The Company is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governments and agencies in areas including, among others, health and safety, import/export, privacy and data protection, FCPA and environmental laws and regulations. Some of the Company\\u2019soperations are subject to domestic and international laws and regulations with respect to the manufacturing, handling, use or sale of toxic or hazardous substances. Some of the Company\\u2019sproducts are also subject to the rules of certain industrial standards bodies, such as the International Standards Organization. Environmental, social and corporate governance (\\u201cESG\\u201d) issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation. Customers, consumers, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, energy and water use, plastic waste and other sustainability concerns. Changing customer and consumer preferences or increased regulatory requirements may result in increased demands or requirements regarding plastics and packaging materials, including single-use and non-recyclable plastic products and packaging, other components of our products and their environmental impact on sustainability, or increased customer and consumer concerns or perceptions (whether accurate or inaccurate) regarding the effects of substances present in certain of our products. GENERAL RISK FACTORS The effects of climate change could harm the Company\\u2019sbusiness. The Company\\u2019smanufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemicals and other substances that are regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. In the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use and/or levels of possible emissions from such chemicals and/or other substances, the Company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to its manufacturing processes. Another potential effect of climate change is an increase in the severity of global weather conditions. Severe weather and geological conditions or events, including earthquakes, hurricanes and/or tsunamis, could potentially cause significant damage to the Company\\u2019smanufacturing facilities in each of these countries.\",\n          \"The production of carrots may be adversely impacted by the events listed above, as well as by water scarcity, crop disease and crop pests.\"\n        ],\n
